GrWebSDR

GrWebSDR is a web SDR receiver.

Build requirements
On Fedora, you will need the following packages:
gnuradio-devel
boost-devel
libvorbis-devel
libogg-devel
libwebsockets-devel
json-c-devel

Build instructions
$ cd src/cpp
$ make

How to run it
$ ./main
Now visit http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.

Known bugs
1. It takes a while for the browser to start playing (initially and when changing
   the demodulation or frequency of the receiver). I believe this is due to
   browser-side buffering of the audio stream.
2. The SSB and especially CW demodulations are likely to be completely unusable.
   Their testing was very limited so far.
