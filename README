Build requirements
On Fedora, you will need the following packages:
gnuradio-devel
boost-devel
libmicrohttpd-devel
libvorbis-devel
libogg-devel
libwebsockets-devel
json-c-devel

Build instructions
$ cd src/cpp
$ make

How to run it
$ ./main
Now visit http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.

Note that the server listens on port 8080 for HTTP and on port 8081 for
WebSocket, so make sure those ports are open in your firewall.

Known bugs
It takes a while for the browser to start playing (initially and when changing
the demodulation or frequency of the receiver). I believe this is due to
browser-side buffering of the audio stream.
